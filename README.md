# Switches 

The LED will light up at any specified orientation of the GrayHill Switch. The 4 poles of the switch represent numbers from 0 to 15, so the orientation of the poles determine the value of the number in binary. When the switch's pole is up, then that represents a HIGH or 1. When the switch's pole is down, then that represents a LOW or 0. Once you've decided which numbers (between 0 - 15) you want to make the LED turn on, then all you need to do is write out a truth table and load it onto your Arduino.
