# Switches

The LED will light up at any specified orientation of the GrayHill Switch. The orientation of the 4 poles of the switch represent numbers from 0 to 15 in binary. When the switch's pole is up, then that represents a HIGH, or 1 and when the pole is down, then that represents a LOW, or 0. Once you've decided which numbers (between 0 - 15) you want to make the LED turn on, then all you need to do is write out a truth table and load it onto your Arduino.

## Requirements 

-Arduino Nano<br />
-Arduino software to code and upload the truth table<br />
-LED<br />
-GrayHill Switch<br />
-22 AUG wires<br />
-5 1kÎ© resistors<br />
-Breadboard<br />
<equipment needed>

## Get started 

### Programming
Initiate the pins you want to use for the INPUTS and OUTPUTS, and set up a pin for the LED. Write out the truth table with the result being HIGH when you want the LED to turn on and LOW for when the LED is off. Properly wire up the Arduino to the computer in order to upload the program.
